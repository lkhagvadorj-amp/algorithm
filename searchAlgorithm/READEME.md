# Best Practises

Here are some best practices for search algorithms based on different use cases:

## Searching for exact matches:

 - Use hash tables if the data is unordered and you need to perform fast lookups. Hash tables are also useful when you need to store metadata about each item (e.g. tags, attributes) that can be used for filtering.
 - Use binary search or interpolation search if the data is ordered and you need to perform fast lookups. These algorithms work best when the data is uniformly distributed.

## Searching for approximate matches:

 - Use linear search or brute force search if the data is small and you don't need to perform many searches. These algorithms are simple and easy to implement, but may be slow for large datasets.
 - Use trie-based algorithms (such as Ternary Search Tries or Radix Trees) if you need to perform prefix or wildcard searches on text data. These algorithms are designed to work with strings and can be efficient for certain types of searches.

## Searching for similarity:

 - Use inverted index if you need to search for documents that contain specific terms. This algorithm works by creating an index of terms that appear in each document, allowing for fast lookups of documents that contain specific terms.
 - Use cosine similarity if you need to compare the similarity of two documents based on their content. This algorithm works by measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors that represent the documents.

## Searching for trends or patterns:

 - Use clustering algorithms (such as K-means or DBSCAN) if you need to group similar items together based on their properties. These algorithms work by grouping items based on their distance to a centroid or based on density.
 - Use association rule mining algorithms (such as Apriori or FP-growth) if you need to find patterns or correlations between items in a dataset. These algorithms work by identifying frequent itemsets or item pairs and then generating rules based on those patterns.

It's important to note that these are just general guidelines and the best algorithm to use will depend on the specific use case and the characteristics of the data being searched. In addition, some algorithms may work better in combination with others, or may need to be modified to suit a particular use case.
