# Simple

To find the missing number in a list of numbers that includes all integers from `0` to `n`, you can use the following algorithm:

 1. Calculate the sum of all integers from `0` to `n` using the formula: `sum = n * (n + 1) / 2`.
 1. Iterate over the list of numbers and calculate the sum of the numbers in the list.
 1. Subtract the sum of the list of numbers from the sum calculated in step 1. The difference is the missing number.

Here's the Python code for this algorithm:
```python
def find_missing_number(numbers):
    n = len(numbers)
    total_sum = (n * (n + 1)) // 2  # Calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to n
    list_sum = sum(numbers)  # Calculate the sum of the numbers in the list
    return total_sum - list_sum  # The difference is the missing number
```

You can call this function with a list of numbers that includes all integers from 0 to n-1, with one number missing:
```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # The number 3 is missing
missing_number = find_missing_number(numbers)
print(missing_number)  # Output: 3
```

Note that this algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where n is the length of the input list.

# Sort Algorithm
Here's the Python code for solving the same problem using a sort algorithm:

```python
def find_missing_number(numbers):
    numbers.sort()  # Sort the list
    n = len(numbers)
    for i in range(n):
        if numbers[i] != i:
            return i  # Return the first missing number found
    return n  # If no missing number is found, return n
```
In this implementation, we first sort the list of numbers. Then we iterate over all the integers from 0 to n-1 and check if each integer is equal to the corresponding number in the sorted list. The first integer that is not equal to its corresponding number is the missing number, so we return it. If no missing number is found, we return n.

You can call this function with a list of numbers that includes all integers from 0 to n-1, with one number missing:
```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # The number 3 is missing
missing_number = find_missing_number(numbers)
print(missing_number)  # Output: 3
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n) for the sorting algorithm and O(n) for iterating over all the integers, so the overall time complexity is O(n log n). However, the actual time complexity will depend on the size of the input and the sorting algorithm used.

# Hash

Here's the Python code for solving the same problem using a hash table:

```python
def find_missing_number(numbers):
    n = len(numbers)
    num_set = set(numbers)  # Convert the list to a set for O(1) lookup
    for i in range(n):
        if i not in num_set:
            return i  # Return the first missing number found
    return n  # If no missing number is found, return n
```

In this implementation, we first convert the list of numbers to a set for O(1) lookup. Then we iterate over all the integers from 0 to n-1 and check if each integer is in the set of numbers. The first integer that is not in the set is the missing number, so we return it. If no missing number is found, we return n.

You can call this function with a list of numbers that includes all integers from 0 to n-1, with one number missing:

```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # The number 3 is missing
missing_number = find_missing_number(numbers)
print(missing_number)  # Output: 3
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n) for creating the set and O(n) for iterating over all the integers, so the overall time complexity is O(n). However, the actual time complexity will depend on the size of the input and the hash table implementation used.
