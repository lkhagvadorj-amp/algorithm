# What is Sorting?
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

## For Example: 
The below list of characters is sorted in increasing order of their ASCII values. That is, the character with a lesser ASCII value will be placed first than the character with a higher ASCII value.

unsorted arrays
```
[2, 1, 4, 3]
```

Array sorted by ascending order
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Array sorted by desceding order
```
[4, 3, 2, 1]
```
